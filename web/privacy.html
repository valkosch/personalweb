      <h2>Transparency and Choice</h2>
      <p>At Poople, we are keenly aware of the trust you place in us and our business opportunity to abuse this. As part of this endeavour, we let you know what information we collect, which you can reject, but we are going to collect it anyways. These informations are crucial to us since YOU are the product we are selling. The shareholders value must grow.

      </p><p>We have 5 <a href="images/loser.gif">privacy principles</a> that describe how we trample privacy across all of our products:
      </p><ol>
        <li>Use information to analyze the users behavior, so we can come up with more profound solutions to sell you more products.
        </li><li>Develop products that reflect mass surveillence standards and practices.
        </li><li>Make the collection of personal information global.
        </li><li>Give users the illusions of choices to protect their privacy.
        </li><li>Be a corporate steward of the information we hold.
      </li></ol>
      <p>This Privacy Center was created to laugh in your face. We know everything about you. We know you are ill, before your body does. We know you are engaged before you even know. We know your religion and poliical ideology. We know who are your friends and family. Last but not least we know what you want to buy next time. Don't worry we are going to use this information at best interest. Trust me bro.
